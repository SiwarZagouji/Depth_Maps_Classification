# RGB-D Image Classification Project

This project involves the classification of RGB-D images using different machine learning models. The project consists of three notebooks, each implementing a different approach for classification.

## Notebooks

- `MLP_Classifier_RGB.ipynb`: Implements the MLP Classifier on RGB images.
- `MLP_Classifier_RGBD.ipynb`: Implements the MLP Classifier on RGBD images.
- `CNN_RGBD.ipynb`: Implements a CNN on RGBD images.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of indoor and outdoor RGB images along with their corresponding depth maps. The dataset is stored in the `data` directory, which contains two subdirectories: `indoors` and `outdoors`. Each subdirectory contains the respective RGB images and depth maps.
